				<h2>Who I am ðŸ§‘</h2>
					<p>I am curious by nature, and I am passionate about history, sports and the world of cinema.  I also appreciate audiovisual or internet content: history documentaries, thematic youtube channels (HugoDÃ©crypte, Nota Bene). Adaptable, I really enjoyed my stays abroad alone. I have been playing tennis since I was 5 years old and I also play basketball, swim, surf and ski.  I would like to work in the world of finance or to be self-employed.</p>

				<h2>Basket</h2>
					<p>I started playing basketball in high school, and what followed was a real passion for the NBA and its history. Reliving the legendary moments of the big league makes me travel.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card-white">
				<h2>History</h2>
					<p>My father was trained as a historian, so I'm obviously very interested in history. If I had to choose the three subjects that interest me the most I would say the First Empire, the Second World War and antiquity in general. I read a lot in order to maintain this passion.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card-white">
				<h2>Movies</h2>
					<p>I had a cinema culture through my family, a lot of old films and classics even if there is a lot missing. We often have video projector nights with friends.</p>
